## Runtime Data

### Usage (stdout):
```Batchfile

TAKEOWN [/S system [/U username [/P [password]]]]
        /F filename [/A] [/R [/D prompt]]

Description:
    This tool allows an administrator to recover access to a file that
    was denied by re-assigning file ownership.

Parameter List: 
    /S           system          Specifies the remote system to
                                 connect to.

    /U           [domain\]user   Specifies the user context under
                                 which the command should execute.

    /P           [password]      Specifies the password for the
                                 given user context.
                                 Prompts for input if omitted.

    /F           filename        Specifies the filename or directory
                                 name pattern. Wildcard "*" can be used
                                 to specify the pattern. Allows
                                 sharename\filename.

    /A                           Gives ownership to the administrators
                                 group instead of the current user.

    /R                           Recurse: instructs tool to operate on
                                 files in specified directory and all 
                                 subdirectories.

    /D           prompt          Default answer used when the current user
                                 does not have the "list folder" permission
                                 on a directory.  This occurs while operating
                                 recursively (/R) on sub-directories. Valid 
                                 values "Y" to take ownership or "N" to skip.

    /SKIPSL                      Do not follow symbolic links.
                                 Only applicable with /R.

    /?                           Displays this help message.

    NOTE: 1) If /A is not specified, file ownership will be given to the
             current logged on user.

          2) Mixed patterns using "?" and "*" are not supported.

          3) /D is used to suppress the confirmation prompt.

Examples: 
    TAKEOWN /?
    TAKEOWN /F lostfile
    TAKEOWN /F \\system\share\lostfile /A
    TAKEOWN /F directory /R /D N
    TAKEOWN /F directory /R /A
    TAKEOWN /F *
    TAKEOWN /F C:\Windows\System32\acme.exe
    TAKEOWN /F %windir%\*.txt
    TAKEOWN /S system /F MyShare\Acme*.doc
    TAKEOWN /S system /U user /F MyShare\MyBinary.dll
    TAKEOWN /S system /U domain\user /P password /F share\filename
    TAKEOWN /S system /U user /P password /F Doc\Report.doc /A
    TAKEOWN /S system /U user /P password /F Myshare\* 
    TAKEOWN /S system /U user /P password /F Home\Logon /R
    TAKEOWN /S system /U user /P password /F Myshare\directory /R /A

```

## takeown

Enables an administrator to recover access to a file that previously was denied, by making the administrator the owner of the file.



### Syntax

```
takeown [/s <Computer> [/u [<Domain>\]<User name> [/p [<Password>]]]] /f <File name> [/a] [/r [/d {Y|N}]]
```

##### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|/s \<Computer>|Specifies the name or IP address of a remote computer (do not use backslashes). The default value is the local computer. This parameter applies to all of the files and folders specified in the command.|
|/u [\<Domain>\]<User name>|Runs the script with the permissions of the specified user account. The default value is system permissions.|
|/p [\<Password>]|Specifies the password of the user account that is specified in the **/u** parameter.|
|/f \<File name>|Specifies the file name or directory name pattern. You can use the wildcard character * when specifying the pattern. You can also use the syntax *ShareName*\*FileName*.|
|/a|Gives ownership to the Administrators group instead of the current user.|
|/r|Performs a recursive operation on all files in the specified directory and subdirectories.|
|/d {Y \| N}|Suppresses the confirmation prompt that is displayed when the current user does not have the "List Folder" permission on a specified directory, and instead uses the specified default value. Valid values for the **/d** option are as follows:</br>-   Y: Take ownership of the directory.</br>-   N: Skip the directory.</br>Note that you must use this option in conjunction with the **/r** option.|
|/?|Displays help at the command prompt.|

### Remarks

-   This command is typically used in batch files.
-   If the **/a** parameter is not specified, file ownership is given to the user who is currently logged on to the computer.
-   Mixed patterns using (**?** and **&#42;**) are not supported by **takeown** command.
-   After deleting the lock with **takeown**, you might have to use Windows Explorer or the **cacls** command to give yourself full permissions to the files and directories before you can delete them. For more information about **cacls**, see "Additional References" at the end of this topic.

### <a name="BKMK_examples"></a>Examples

To take ownership of a file named Lostfile, type:
```
takeown /f lostfile
```
